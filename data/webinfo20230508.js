knot intelligence hand intelligence

- problem with the physics of LLM 
	- opaque parameters / dimensions / variables
	- circular train / evaluation ::: limited dataset / limited feedback providers / limited evaluation data
	- escher mirror ... show me what a tech worker looks like ... check! looks right to me!
	- complexity of model ::: not human-understandable, not "elegant"
		-putting resources / effort / emphasis on self-documenting nural leaps / compression / distillation ... filters / assumptions / the shape of data that honed parameters has no market value
		- tech is always seen as "resource-less" "objective" "cloud-like" "all-knowing" "pure" "outside the market" just thought science progress not dirty oil-burning, skewed, colonialist, ... this is the manhattan project ... a bunch of brilliant minds (white, priviledged men) working to push forward human understandiing of the world
		- like a "classics" education ... "The Classics" 
	- a world / landscape of text ::: worldly, tactile, cross-sensory experience filtered through text is the basis for LLM
	- averaging ::: we can all sound like the mean expression of slanted datasets
- problem with the environmental cost of LLM AI
- problem with the data of AI
- problem with the tool of AI in art production / human communication

## Notes on touch ##

Glass touch ::: tap tap tap ::: reduction of communication to body-less, linear, word tapping ::: message transmission

Need for language to talk about AI models in the commons
See the rapid innovation and language emergence in the ProTactile community
Interest in the expanded meaning of a touch-centered communication mode

the role of the artist ::: resist flood refuse queer-up dada
uber ze honey hive ::: electric phosynthetic queen ::: networked revolutionaries artists of the world :::
pollinate
